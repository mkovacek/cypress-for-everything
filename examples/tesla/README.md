# Tesla

I love Tesla as a brand and as a company!

I implemented the following features to grow my experience with cypress while being able to test more complex patterns:
- [tesla-menu.ts](cypress/integration/tesla-menu.ts): checking the main menu checking for the main company products to be present and clickable! ✨
- [tesla-trips.ts](cypress/integration/tesla-trips.ts): checking the trips page, testing if it's possible to plan a complete trip from Italy to Germany and much more!]  ✨
- [tesla-multiple-viewports.ts](cypress/integration/tesla-multiple-viewports.ts): checking the "Tesla Model 3" product page with multiple viewports, testing if the page is responsive and works on mobile and desktop! ✨
